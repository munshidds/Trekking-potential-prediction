Overview

Topic = Trekking potential prediction
In this project, It is predicted that whether a person will be capable of hiking or not, by analysing certain 
features such as age, height, weight, gender, habits like smoking or not, fascination towards the journey ,
climate, jeep service, package price, and feedback of former hikers , with the help of some collected datas.

Motive

I have some reasons for create Trekking potential prediction, basically, i am a trekking lover, when I was a 
trekking, I could see that some one of persons were struggling for reaching the target. The reason why they 
were struggling is their fitness wasn’t okay for the journey. I am sure that using a web like this before come,
they can understand whether they were  able to do this trekking or not
